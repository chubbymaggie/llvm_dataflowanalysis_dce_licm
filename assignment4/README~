I implement the dominator analysis in domAnalysis.h under the IDFA framework.

Dominator Analysis:
***INPUT***
A Control Flow Graph (CFG) with all basicblocks B and the predecessor and successor relationship.
***OUTPUT***
Dominator[B] = OUT[B], the set of nodes that dominate B
***DETAIL***
1. Direction: forward
2. Domain: the power set of all blocks
3. Transfer Function: f(x) = x U {B}
4. Meet Operator: Intersection
5. Initial Flow Value: Universal Set
6. Boundary Condition: IN[entry] = Empty Set
7. DataFlow Equations:
--OUT[B] = f(IN[B])
--In[B] = INTERSECTION_(P in pred(B)) OUT(P)
